#Motivation




# Further Information
Looking for more explanation? The code itself is documented in a way meant to be read and understood easily. A good place to start with this package would be:
```python
dictableobj.Tests.main
```

# TODO
 Currently there are yet to be implimented features:
 * Complete recurrent layer capability so sequential networks may be evolved, such has LSTM
 * Higher dimensionality of layers must be added in order to support typical computer vision applications such as 2-D Convolutions
